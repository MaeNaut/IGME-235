            Hello, my name is Hyunwoo Park. I'm currently in my second year as a Game Design and Development major at RIT. <br>
            My biggest interest is playing and watching video games, and now I'm studying to make them, which sounds cool! <br>
            From this class, IGME 235, I hope to learn how web-based games work and improve my coding skills in making them. <br>
            My goal after graduating is to get into the game development field ASAP so that I can make things for gamers worldwide. <br>

        </p>
