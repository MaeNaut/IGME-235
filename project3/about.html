    <h1>Fast Math</h1>

    <h2>Game Description</h2>
    <p>
        The game will give two random mathematical formulas each round with a time limit.<br>
        The player has to choose the one with greater or lower value to complete the round.<br>
        The time limit becomes shorter as the round proceeds.<br>
        If the player chooses the wrong formula or time is over, they lose.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Genre</h2>
    <p>Quiz</p>

    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <p>Both desktop web and mobile web</p>

    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>There is no story.</p>

    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <p>
        The design will be super simple and abstract. Though, I will find out the best layout so that<br>
        the player will be able to read the question, formulas, and time as fast as possible.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
        The player just chooses between two formulas using left mouse click.<br>
        The first round will give a plenty of time for players to understand what's going on.<br>
